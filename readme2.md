# ---------------------- Git branch & merging ----------

1. git branch (To check which branches we have)
    * main

2. git branch working (To create a new branch)

3. git branch (Again checking which branches we have)

     * main
       working

4. git checkout working (switch to working branch)
      readme.md
      Switched to branch 'working'

4. git branch (Again check which branch we work)
    
      main
     * working

5. In these we added some another file and the process of commit is same

  - git add .
  - git commit -m "Added working file"
  - git push origin working

6. git branch main

7. git merge design
